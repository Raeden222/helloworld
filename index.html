<h3>Yo, yo, yo, it’s the apple rap,  
Crunchy and sweet, put us on the map!  
Red, green, yellow, we got every hue,  
Take a bite of health, it’s good for you!

From the orchard to your plate,  
Apples keep you feeling great.  
Slice ‘em, dice ‘em, bake a pie,  
An apple a day, give it a try!

Vitamin C and fiber too,  
Juicy, tasty, good for you.  
So grab an apple, don’t delay,  
Let’s rap about apples every day!</h3>
